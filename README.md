| **General**      | General track - DAOs & Governance                  | 1Review provides a way for users of Web3 products to exercise Governance by Opinion. Using product reviews and feedback, Web3 projects can iterate faster, build tools and products most liked by their users, and get even more community buy-in into their Web3 Governance initiatives.                                                                                                                                  |

| **CELO**         | Community Commerce                                 | 1Review aims to create an ecosystem of businesses who get paid in bounties to review products and provide feedback                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Filecoin**     | Social Good Warrior                                | 1Review aims to reduce misinformation in online reviews by providing an incentive-based model to reviews. Spam reduction and elimination is designed by default because each user has to pay gas fees to write reviews                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Coinbase**     | General Bounty                                     | 1Review aims to create an ecosystem of businesses who get paid in bounties to review products and provide feedback                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Verida**       | Social Challenge                                   | 1Review is a decentralized social platform that allows users of Web3 projects to discover other users, interact and engage with them and provide meaningful feedback to Web3 developer teams. Data on 1Review is completely owned by the users who created it. Accessibility and transparency are key features of 1Review and are built in by default. We believe this is a great use-case for decentralized social.       |
| **Data Nexus**   | Best app for new-to-web3 users                     | 1Review is built for new-to-web3 users who want to discover trending Web3 projects. We know how daunting it can be to enter a Web3 community run rampant with crypto degens. 1Review is an attempt to cut through the noise, and help new (and old) crypto users to provide meaningful feedback and engage in discourse. In the process, 1Review rewards new Web3 users with project feedback bounties.                    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **Livepeer**     | Killer Web3 social, creator, or gaming application | 1Review aims to become the first widely used Web3 social platform. With its unique integration with all Web3 projects and protocols, 1Review allows users to provide feedback and reviews for any Web3 product. Each user profile is minted as an NFT on the Polygon network, and all data is owned by the user who created it. Reviews are immutable, pinned to IPFS, and eternally available and accessible to everyone. |
| **Decentraland** | Insight Challenge                                  | 1Review provides a framework to implement decentralized reviews for Decentraland users. Decentraland reviews can help users discover more sub-communities and engage with each other in thoughtful discourse about the future of Decentraland                                                                                                                                                                              |

## The Project

**1Review** is a fully decentralized, trustless Web3 platform for product feedback and reviews built for **Web3 Organizations**. Users can write reviews, provide feedback and earn bounties for behavior that benefits Web3 projects and infrastructure. All data on the platform is tamper-proof and accessible to the entire internet through the Lens Protocol Subgraph.

The explosive growth of crypto projects, DAOs and financial products in the last few months has outpaced the growth of Web2 platforms that people are still using for product discovery. 1Review aims to solve this problem by providing a platform with fair data ownership and accessibility primitives.

## The Problem

Web2 companies like Google, Amazon and Yelp collect user feedback for products and businesses on their platform and use this information to build their own products. However, this information is not made readily available to businesses that need it to build better products. Moreover, users have to navigate from one platform to another to read and analyze product reviews which leads to asymmetric decision making in a world filled with choice paralysis.

Web3 needs better.

## Our Solution

1Review exposes two front-end applications:

- Chrome Extension: To easily navigate from product pages to the 1Review Dapp for browsing previous feedback and leaving new reviews
- A Dapp: To read reviews, create a 1Review profile, log into profile, write feedback and participate in bounties

The following diagram goes over the high-level architecture of the 1Review ecosystem:
